# Property Name Classifier

I wanted to try and predice the `Type` given the `Name` of a property. Since most programmers try and be idiomatic I figured it would be a predictible thing to do.

I added a lot of "SDK" nuget packages and scanned those assemblies for properties and their names.

The rest is Mult-classification prediction using ML.NET.

Enjoy!

## TBD

Trying to find a bigger dataset. Currently `data.csv` is about 5,000 rows. If you have a larger dataset, please feel free to submit a pull request.

Thanks,

Khalid
